========

This package provides utilities for eddy covariance data handling, quality checking (similar to Mauder et al., 2013), processing, summarising and plotting. It aims to standardise the automated quality checking and make data processing reproducible.

Example

An extended example describing the intended eddy covariance data processing workflow is available at:
